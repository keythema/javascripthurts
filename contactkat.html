		<h2><b><u>5 Reasons you should travel!!</u></b></h2>
				<h3><p class="wordsize"><p span class="indent">There</span> are so many reasons that you should travel!! Here are my Top 5 reasons you should buy a plane ticket right now and get out of here!!</p></h2>	
				<ol type"1">
					<li><u><p class="b1">Food</u></p></li>
					<p class="h3">If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of the same-o, same-o foods in your fridge and cabinets. Traveling to another country, you will be opened up to a world of new foods, seasonings, sauces and more!</p>
					<li><u><p class="b1">Tourist Sites </u></p></li>
					<P class="h3"> I will never forget the first time I saw a castle, a real-life castle from the fairy tales and fiction television shows. It was truly breath-taking but there is just so much more to see. If you know your city like the back of your hand,...it's time to get out and get exploring.</p>
					<li><u><p class="b1">Language</u></p></li>
					<p class="h3">You may not need to learn german but you will never forget the feeling of standing in the middle of a town you can't pronounce, with signs you acn't understand and people you cant communicate with. Its a good feeling, or at least an interestsing one lol At the very least, you will have a newfound mountain of patience the next time you call your service provider because you will remember back when it was you desperately trying to communicate.</p>
					<li><u><p class="b1">Appreciation</u></p></li>
					<p class="h3">You know how you go to the store to buy a bag of Doritos, and you stand in the middle of the aisle wrought with indecision because there are just too many dang choices!! Yea, you won't have That problem standing in the middle of small town in Ibague, Colombia. There are two flavors, just two!! You will never appreciate the luxury of choice fully until you don't have it, but you will learn to appreciate the things in life that really matter like friends, family, and living life.</p>
					<li><u><p class="b1">Trump is President </u></p></li>
					<p class="h3"> I mean this one is self-explanatory, there's never been a better time to travel. We have an orange neo-nazi running our country, there's literally more to fear Staying in the United States, so opt for a short escape-cation and expand your horizons!!</p>
					</ul>
